Docker Image with MkDocs. It's using tiny image provided by Alpine.
MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Purpose of this image was to simplify the process of deploying MkDocs. This image is based on Alpine Linux to minimize the size of the image.
