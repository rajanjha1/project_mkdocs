Project_MKDOCS

MkDocs in a docker image.

This project is about using Docker to encapsulate a tool called Mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/) to produce and serve a website which would help to keep our computer clean while we can simply rely ondocker and its isolation.

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.To keep the image lightweight, we are using alpine Linux. Once we create a docker image, this would simplify the process of deploying mkdocs locally.
