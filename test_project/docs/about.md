Hello All !! Hope you are doing well.

This is Rajan here and I currently work as a software professional based out of Bangalore.
I work for a US based SAAS firm , Manhattan Associates,. Prior to this, I have worked with IBM, Dimension data and Igate(now capgemini).
I love to cycle around and play TT mostly on weekends, while in my free time I keep myself updated with technology and recent movies/shows. 

Thank you.
